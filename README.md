# 🌱 My Python Journey — The Garden

First of all, This repo is more than code, it's a living record of how Python grew on me, lesson by lesson.

## Python00: The Hidden Roots

It looked easy: a few short exercises, a handful of print statements, 
nothing fancy. Simple logic, simple outputs. A gentle introduction.  
But real growth is hidden; every small win built confidence.  

> They said, "It's just the basics."  
> Only a few could see the roots growing deeper.

## Python01: Sprouting Up

Suddenly, code had structure—classes, methods, blueprints.  
Things connected. Lists tangled, loops circled back.  
Sometimes messy, often exciting. The garden was alive and growing.

## Python02: The Weather Changes

Errors blew in. Suddenly, things broke: ValueErrors, zero divisions, missing files.  
Panicked? Sure. But learning to catch and handle storms became the lesson.  
Exceptions aren’t setbacks—they’re just rain watering the roots.

> “Good programmers are not those who never make mistakes, but those who learn to handle the unexpected storm.”

## Python03: Full Bloom

Now: systems, stats, inventories, achievements.  
Command-line magic, data wrangled, stories told in code.  
It isn’t just about writing code anymore, it’s building something that responds, learns, and grows.

> “Underestimate nothing. Every simple line prepares you for the wild, thriving garden yet to come.”
